                    To do so, the scientist create me, Curiosity. I'm a rover in charge to found water, marks or any other elements who chould provide theory about inhabitant or no living beings.

                    My mission started the 06 august 2012 and will last 98 weeks. This mission, whoâ€™s endowed of a 2.5 billions dollars budget, is exceptional.

                    I'm going to measure the radiation level on field thanks to my Rad instruments. Despite my size, I can be very precise and I can land in a place that is no flat. My responsible at NASA have chosen to land me in the crater of Gale. Finally, I never sleep. I can work 24 hours a day with my superpowered generator of radioactive plutonium.
