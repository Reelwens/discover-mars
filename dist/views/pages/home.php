            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm going to measure the radiation level on field thanks to my Rad instruments. Despite my size, I can be very precise and I can land in a place that is no flat. My responsible at NASA have chosen to land me in the crater of Gale. Finally, I never sleep. I can work 24 hours a day with my superpowered generator of radioactive plutonium.
